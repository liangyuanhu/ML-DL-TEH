# R and Python codes for estimating heterogeneous survival treatment effect via Machine/Deep Learning methods in observational studies. 
# We considered 7 machine/deep learning methods designed for right-censored survival outcomes, and contributed a series of simulations to evaluate the operating characteristics of these methods for estimating the treatment effect heterogeneity. A case study examining the heterogeneous treatment effects of two radiotherapy approaches for treating high-risk prostate cancer demonstrates the methods.
